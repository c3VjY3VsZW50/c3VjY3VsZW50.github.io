<H2><A NAME="compatibility_issues_with_third_party_pppoe_clients_naeb"></A> Compatibility Issues with Non-Microsoft PPPoE Client Applications</H2>

<P>This note applies if you are using a non-Microsoft virtual private network (VPN) application to access your computer remotely.</P>

<P>Many non-Microsoft Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) client applications do not operate properly or install correctly with Windows&nbsp;XP. If your Internet service provider (ISP) requires PPPoE to connect to the Internet, you can solve PPPoE problems by using the PPPoE client in Windows&nbsp;XP, or you can request a Windows&nbsp;XP&ndash;compatible PPPoE client application from your software vendor or ISP. </P>

<P>If you use one of the following products, contact the vendor for a Windows&nbsp;XP&ndash;compatible version of their software:</p>

<UL>
	<LI>WinPoET version 2.1a or earlier</li>
	<LI>EnterNet 300 version 1.34 or earlier.</li></UL>

<P class="proclabel">To make a connection by using the PPPoE client included in Windows&nbsp;XP</p>
<OL>
	<LI>Click <B>Start</B>, click <B>Control Panel</B>, and then click <B>Network and Internet Connections</B>.</li>

</li>
	<LI>Follow the steps in the wizard. 
	<p>You can choose to leave <B>ISP Name</B> blank. If you do, Windows&nbsp;XP will attempt to detect the connection.</p>
</li></OL>

<H2><A NAME="legacy_networking_components_zpcb"></A>Networking Protocols That Windows&nbsp;XP No Longer Supports</H2>

<P>Windows&nbsp;XP no longer supports some networking protocols because the functionality that these network protocols provided has been replaced by equivalent functionality in the TCP/IP protocol suite. </P>

<P>The networking protocols that Windows&nbsp;XP no longer supports are as follows:</p>

<UL>
	<LI>NetBIOS Extended User Interface (NetBEUI), a non-routable protocol</li>
	<LI>Data Link Control (DLC), a non-routable protocol</li>
	<LI>AppleTalk, a protocol used with Apple computers</li></UL>

<H2><A NAME="telnet_client_veiq"></A> Telnet Client Applications on VTNT Terminals for East Asian Languages</H2>

<H2><A NAME="wireless_networking_devices_rgat"></A> Wireless Networking Devices</H2>

<H3><A NAME="orinoco_wireless_lan_card_ilok"></A> ORiNOCO Wireless LAN card</H3>

<P>If you install the utilities from the ORiNOCO Wireless LAN card CD, Windows&nbsp;XP Wireless Configuration Service will not run correctly. This is because these utilities interfere with the control of the card. As a result, the wireless configuration tab in the network properties does not appear, and the card does not configure automatically.</P>

<P class="proclabel">To correct problems with the ORiNOCO Wireless LAN card</p>

<OL>
	<LI>Remove ORiNOCO Utilities through <B>Add or Remove Programs</B> in Control Panel.</li>
	<LI>Use Device Manager to uninstall the ORiNOCO card.
<P>To open Device Manager, click <B>Start</B>, and then click <B>Control Panel</B>. Click <B>Performance and Maintenance</B>, and then click <B>System</B>. On the <B>Hardware</B> tab, click <B>Device Manager</B>.</p></li>

<P>This information applies to wireless devices that use the following standards:</p>

<UL>
	<LI>IEEE 802.11 wireless Ethernet LAN standard</li>
	<LI>IEEE 802.1X port-based network access control authentication standard</li></UL>

<P>If you use IEEE 802.11 wireless configuration and the network authentication protocol IEEE 802.1X, user information and requests for action are displayed through balloon notifications that appear in the notification area in the lower right-hand corner of your screen.</P>

<P>After you upgrade to Windows&nbsp;XP, however, this icon might not appear. After you complete the installation, check to determine whether the icon appears. If it does not appear, use the following procedure to correct this problem.</p>

<P class="proclabel"><b>To make the network icon appear in the notification area</b></P>
<OL>

<h2>Software Compatibility and SP2</h2>
<p>For information about software compatibility issues that can arise with SP2, see <A ID="MSUrl" HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=23354" TITLE="http://www.microsoft.com/" TARGET="_blank"><u>Windows&nbsp;XP Service Pack&nbsp;2 Resources for IT Professionals</u></A> on the  Microsoft TechNet Web site.</p>

<H2><A NAME="antivirus_programs_rlzg"></A> Antivirus Software</H2>

<P>You must ensure that your antivirus software is written for the version of Windows&nbsp;XP that your computer is running. This means that the software must be written specifically for either Windows&nbsp;XP Home Edition or Windows&nbsp;XP Professional, or for both operating systems. </P>
<P>Antivirus drivers that are not written to run on your specific Windows&nbsp;XP operating system might cause problems. For instance, the software might not be able to perform real-time scanning for viruses, which could make your system more vulnerable to virus attack.</P> 

<P>The problems that can result range in severity from those that are less severe&mdash;such as recoverable errors&mdash;to problems that are quite severe&mdash;such as losing some or all of your data, or having your computer become unusable.</P> 

<P>To prevent these problems, check your antivirus software to ensure that it is designed for your operating system. If you have questions about this, or if you discover that you need to obtain appropriate antivirus software, contact your software vendor. </P>

<H2><A NAME="microsoft_agent_zhoq"></A> Microsoft Agent</H2>

<P>Windows&nbsp;XP supports Speech Application Programming Interface (SAPI) version 5.0 engines and programs. To prevent a loss of functionality in Microsoft Agent applications that use SAPI version 4.0 speech input or output engines, you must install SAPI version 4.0a run-time support, and then reinstall the SAPI version 4.0 speech engines. You must do this even if they were working with Microsoft Agent before you upgraded to Windows&nbsp;XP.</P> 

<p>Use the following link to install SAPI version 4.0a run-time support:</P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=3354" TARGET="_blank"><U>Install SAPI version 4.0a run-time support</U></A></LI>
</UL>


<H2><A NAME="smtp_authentication_iabx"></A> SMTP Authentication</H2>

<P>This note pertains to Windows&nbsp;XP Professional only.</P>

<P>You can configure the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service in Windows&nbsp;XP to require clients to authenticate before issuing mail commands. When you install or upgrade to Windows&nbsp;XP Professional in a workgroup, the authentication options NTLM (formerly called Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;LAN Manager) and Generic Security Services API (GSSAPI) do not work because a registry key is set that forces guest-only authentication.</P>

<P>You can solve this problem by setting the force guest authentication registry key.</P> 

<P>For more information, see article <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=28512" TARGET="_blank"><U>304707</U></A>, &quot;SMTP Authentication Configuration on Windows&nbsp;XP Professional Edition,&quot; in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.</P>

<P CLASS="caution">Caution</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
Incorrectly editing the registry can severely damage your system. Before making changes to the registry, you should back up any valued data on the computer.

<H2><A NAME="logical_volume_manager_tqkl"></A> Logical Volume Manager</H2>

<P>Local device drive names (each of which is a letter of the alphabet) are usually assigned incrementally, starting with the letter C (C, D, E, and so on). Network drive names are automatically assigned in reverse order, starting with Z (Z, Y, X, and so on). </P>

<P>Conflicts between drive letters and existing network shared drives can arise if you connect digital cameras or other devices that use memory sticks to Windows&nbsp;XP while the computer is running. Similar conflicts can arise if you add external drives (such as USB or 1394 disks). If a naming conflict arises with an existing network shared drive, the device or external drive becomes inaccessible. </P>

<P>To prevent this problem, allow Windows to automatically assign network drive names, or choose letters higher in the alphabet for your drive names.</P>

<H2><A NAME="volume_management_dlmz"></A> Volume Management</H2>

<P>Windows&nbsp;XP does not support Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT&reg; 4.0 Ftdisk volume sets.</P> 

<P>If you are running Microsoft Windows&nbsp;2000, you must convert all Ftdisk volume sets to dynamic volumes before you upgrade to Windows&nbsp;XP. If you are running Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0, you should break all mirrored volumes and back up all data on stripe, RAID5, or extended-volume sets before you upgrade to Windows&nbsp;XP. Ftdisk sets might be inaccessible after you perform the upgrade.</P>
