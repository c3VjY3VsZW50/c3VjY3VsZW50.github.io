      <H2>Installation overview</H2>
	  
<p>This release of Windows&nbsp;XP includes Service Pack&nbsp;2 (SP2) for Windows&nbsp;XP. If you uninstall this release of Windows&nbsp;XP, SP2 is automatically uninstalled too. Your computer will be running the operating system that it was running before you installed Windows&nbsp;XP, or it will not be running an operating system. You cannot uninstall SP2 only.</p>

<P CLASS="important">Important</P>
<UL>
	<LI>You can install Windows&nbsp;XP Home Edition with Service Pack&nbsp;2 or Windows&nbsp;XP Professional with Service Pack&nbsp;2 on computers that are running the following operating systems:
	<UL>
		<LI>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;98</LI>
		<LI>Windows&nbsp;98 Second Edition</LI>
		<LI>Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 Workstation</LI>
		<LI>Windows&nbsp;Millennium Edition</LI>
		<LI>Windows&nbsp;2000 Professional</LI>
		<LI>Windows&nbsp;XP Home Edition</LI>
		<LI>Windows&nbsp;XP Professional</LI>
	</UL></LI>
	<LI>If you want to upgrade Microsoft Windows&nbsp;95 to Windows&nbsp;XP Home Edition or Windows&nbsp;XP  Professional, you must first uninstall Windows&nbsp;95, and then perform a new installation.</LI>
	<LI>If you are installing Windows&nbsp;XP on an older computer, it’s a good idea to check with your computer manufacturer to see whether a BIOS upgrade is available before you proceed.</LI></UL>

<A NAME="_Toc42069040"></A><H1>Prepare for Setup</H1>

<P>There are four important steps you should take before you start Setup:</P>
<OL>
 	<LI><A HREF="#a">Run an upgrade report</A> &ndash; it only takes a few minutes to check system compatibility.</LI>
	<LI><A HREF="#b">Disable virus protection software</A> &ndash; if you do not do this, installation might fail.</LI>
 	<LI><A HREF="#c">Back up your files</A> either by using the Backup Wizard that is built into Windows, or by using another backup program.</LI>
 	<LI><A HREF="#d">Decide which type of Setup you want</A> &ndash; an upgrade or a new installation.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Doing these four steps <I>before</I> starting Setup can save you time in the long run.</P>


<H2><A NAME="a">Run an upgrade report</A></H2>

<P>An upgrade report tells you how your hardware and software will work with Windows&nbsp;XP. The upgrade report is a quick and easy program that you can run using the Windows&nbsp;XP CD. Here's how:</P>
<OL>
 	<LI>Insert the Windows&nbsp;XP CD into your CD-ROM drive.</LI>
 	<LI>When the <B>Welcome</B> menu appears, click <B>Check system compatibility</B>.</LI>
 	<LI>Then click <B>Check my system automatically</B>.</LI>
</OL>

<P>You can also find information about your computer's devices (such as printers, scanners, and so on) at the device manufacturer's Web site, in the Windows Catalog, and on the Microsoft Hardware Compatibility List (HCL): </P>

	<P CLASS="indent"><A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=20496">Text version of the HCL (for all operating systems)</A><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="printonly">(https://winqual.microsoft.com/download/default.asp)</SPAN></P>
	
	<P CLASS="indent"><A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=20497">Text version of the HCL (for Windows&nbsp;XP only)</A><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="printonly">(https://winqual.microsoft.com/download/display.asp?FileName=hcl/WinXPHCLx86.txt)</SPAN></P>
	
	<P CLASS="indent"><A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=18784">The Windows Catalog</A><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="printonly">(http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/)</SPAN></P>
	
	<P CLASS="indent">You can get to all of the above from <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=14123">Windows Hardware and Driver Central</A><SPAN CLASS="printonly"> (http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hcl/default.mspx)</SPAN></P>

<P>What do you do if something is incompatible with Windows&nbsp;XP? You can upgrade either the hardware or software in question, find a similar but compatible program or device, or you can remove the program or device and stop using it. To upgrade, contact the manufacturer. To find compatible programs and devices, check the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=18784">Windows Catalog</A><SPAN CLASS="printonly"> (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/)</SPAN>. To remove a program, go to Control Panel and open Add or Remove Programs.</P>

<H2><A NAME="b">Disable virus protection (antivirus) software</A></H2>

<P>Virus protection software sometimes interferes with Setup, so make sure that you disable it before you begin installing Windows&nbsp;XP. For instructions about how to do this, refer to the documentation for your virus protection software.</P>

<P>After setting up Windows&nbsp;XP, remember to enable the virus protection program. In some cases you will need an updated version of the software, which you might be able to download from the software manufacturer's Web site.</P>

<H2><A NAME="c">Back up your files</A></H2>

<P>Back up any files that you want to preserve, just in case something goes awry. Depending on how many files you have, you can copy them to a floppy disk, removable drive, or CD, or to a network folder if you have a network. You can copy the files directly or use the Backup Wizard included with most versions of Windows. This wizard is located in the Accessories\System Tools folder on the <B>Start</B> menu.</P>

<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B> You cannot restore a backup in Windows&nbsp;XP that you created by using the Msbackup tool in Windows&nbsp;95, Windows&nbsp;98, or Windows Millennium Edition. For more information about this issue, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 305381, "Cannot Restore Backups That You Create in Windows&nbsp;95, Windows&nbsp;98, or Windows Me with the Windows&nbsp;XP NTBackup Tool."</P>


<H2><A NAME="d">Decide which type of Setup you want</A></H2>

<P>There are basically three different types of Setup: an upgrade, a new installation (also known as a <I>clean installation</I> or a <I>full installation</I>), and a multiboot installation. <I><B>Hint:</B> we highly recommend the first one!</I></P>

<P><B>Upgrade</B>. This is the easiest method of installing Windows&nbsp;XP. We recommend you use this method if you are running a previous version of Windows. When you upgrade, you replace the existing operating system with Windows&nbsp;XP, but your data and most user settings should not be affected. (It's always a good idea to back up your files before starting, just in case.)</P>

<P>You can upgrade from Windows&nbsp;98, Windows&nbsp;98 Second Edition, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation&nbsp;4 (Service Pack&nbsp;6), or Windows&nbsp;2000 Professional.</P>

<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B> Windows&nbsp;2000 can only be upgraded to Windows&nbsp;XP Professional. See Microsoft Knowledge Base article 292607 for supported upgrade paths. Also see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 316941 for an overview of the Windows&nbsp;XP Setup process.</P>

<P CLASS="note"><B>Tip:</B> To find a Microsoft Knowledge Base article, go to <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=992">Microsoft Help and Support</A><SPAN CLASS="printonly"> (http://support.microsoft.com)</SPAN>, type the article number in the <B>Search the Knowledge Base</B> box, and press ENTER.</P>

<P><B>New installation</B>. Also known as a full installation or a clean installation, this method requires a little more work than an upgrade. A new installation can install Windows&nbsp;XP on another drive or partition without disturbing an existing installation, or you can choose to wipe out everything on your hard drive so that you "start from scratch." <B>You should definitely back up your files before doing a new installation!</B> As part of a new installation, you can also partition and format your hard drive. It's best to do this as part of Setup, rather than doing it in advance (as you might have done with previous versions of Windows). We'll get to that.</P>

<P><B>Multiboot installation</B>. The hardest of all three, this method is a variation of the new installation process that lets you run more than one operating system on your computer. For example, you can have both Windows&nbsp;XP and Windows&nbsp;98 installed. To switch from one to the other, you restart the computer and choose an operating system from a menu that appears when the computer starts. Sounds cool, but don't attempt this unless you are an advanced computer user.</P>


<H1><A NAME="_Toc42069041">Upgrade to Windows&nbsp;XP</A></H1>

<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B> Before installing Windows&nbsp;XP, you should disable your virus protection (antivirus) software, and you might want to run the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool to test your computer's random access memory (RAM). To use the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool, follow the instructions on the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19751">Windows Memory Diagnostic</A><SPAN CLASS="printonly"> (http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp)</SPAN> Web site. Be sure to enable your virus protection software after installing Windows&nbsp;XP.</P>

<P>When you upgrade to Windows&nbsp;XP, you install Windows to the same folder where your current version of Windows is located, updating the earlier version. Here's how:</P>

<OL>
 	<LI>Start your computer. Also, make sure you have your product key handy.</LI>
 	<LI>Insert the Windows&nbsp;XP CD into your computer's CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.</LI>
 	<LI>On the menu that appears, click <B>Install Windows&nbsp;XP</B>.</LI>
 	<LI>On the <B>Welcome to Windows Setup</B> page, click <B>Upgrade (recommended)</B> (if it is not already selected), and then click <B>Next</B>. (You should click <B>Next</B> on each screen from here on.)</LI>
 	<LI>On the <B>License Agreement</B> page, read the agreement, and follow the instructions to accept or reject the agreement.</LI>
 	<LI>On the <B>Your Product Key</B> page, type the 25-character product key in the appropriate boxes.</LI>
 	<LI>On the <B>Get Updated Setup Files</B> page, select the option that you want. <I><B>Hint:</B> It's a really good idea to select <B>Yes</B> and get the updated files, but you can only do this if you're able to connect to the Internet.</I>
   		<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B> Some of the problems addressed in the troubleshooting section of this document are prevented by getting the updated Setup files.</P></LI>
	 <LI>During this phase of Setup, the computer will restart several times, and you'll see screens telling you about new features in Windows&nbsp;XP. This part of Setup takes a while. It's a good time to go have a cup of coffee or take a break.</LI>
 	<LI>Finally, the computer restarts one last time and Windows&nbsp;XP starts.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Do not forget to enable your virus protection software after Setup is finished.</P>

<H1><A NAME="_Toc42069042">Perform a new installation of Windows&nbsp;XP</A></H1>

<P>If your computer does not have an operating system currently installed or you have decided to install Windows from scratch, you can perform what is known as a new installation (also known as a <I>clean installation</I>, or a <I>full installation</I>). This process is more complicated and takes longer than an upgrade (about 20 steps as opposed to 9 for an upgrade). To perform an upgrade, refer to the section titled "<A HREF="#_Toc42069041">Upgrade to Windows&nbsp;XP</A>."</P>

<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B> Before installing Windows&nbsp;XP, you should disable you virus protection (antivirus) software, and you might want to run the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool to test your computer's random access memory (RAM). To use the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool, follow the instructions on the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19751">Windows Memory Diagnostic</A><SPAN CLASS="printonly"> (http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp)</SPAN> Web site. Be sure to enable your virus protection software after installing Windows&nbsp;XP.</P>

<P CLASS="note"><B>CAUTION:</B> You can choose to delete everything that currently exists on the hard drive during a new installation, so be sure to back up any data you want to keep before you begin (make sure that the backup data is not stored on the drive you are going to delete).</P>

<P>Here's how to perform a new installation of Windows&nbsp;XP:</P>

<OL>
 	<LI>Insert the Windows&nbsp;XP CD into the CD-ROM drive. 
   		<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B> Make sure the computer can boot from a CD. If it can't, then follow the procedures in the section titled "<A HREF="#_Toc42069048">Configure a computer to boot from CD</A>" or see the "How do I install Windows from the command prompt?" section under "<A HREF="#_Toc42069045">Perform other Setup-related tasks</A>."</P></LI>
	<LI>Restart the computer.</LI>
 	<LI>When the message to <B>Press any key to boot from CD…</B> is displayed, quickly press any key (for example, the SPACEBAR). Setup begins.
   		<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B>  Pay close attention here, because it's very easy to miss this message. If your current operating system starts, you'll know that you missed the opportunity to boot from CD. Restart your computer and try again.</P></LI>
	<LI>After Setup starts, several messages will flash across the bottom of the screen. These messages are only important under special circumstances, such as installing a particular hardware access layer (HAL), or loading a small computer system interface (SCSI) driver. Most people can ignore them. For more information about this subject, see Microsoft Knowledge Base articles 295116 and 220845.</LI>
 	<LI>Next, a screen appears that offers the following three options: <B>Set up Windows&nbsp;XP</B>, <B>Repair a Windows&nbsp;XP installation</B>, or <B>Quit Setup</B>. Press ENTER to select the first option.</LI>
 	<LI>The End User License Agreement appears next. Read the license agreement and follow the instructions to accept or reject the agreement. If your <NOLOC>Windows</NOLOC> CD is an upgrade CD, after accepting the agreement, you will be prompted to insert the CD of your previous operating system to verify that the previous version qualifies for upgrade to Windows&nbsp;XP.
   		<P CLASS="note"><B>Important!</B> If you use a recovery CD from an original equipment manufacturer (also called an OEM), it is possible that the CD will not be accepted. If you delete the partition information or format the drive and the OEM recovery CD is not accepted as valid media, you must use the OEM recovery CD to restore your previous version of Windows. For details about restoring your system using the OEM recovery media, please contact your computer manufacturer.</P></LI>
 	<LI>If a screen appears showing an existing installation of Windows&nbsp;XP, press ESC to continue installing a fresh copy of Windows&nbsp;XP.</LI>
 	<LI>At the next screen, you have the option of repartitioning your drive. It's a good idea to repartition if you want to merge several smaller partitions into one large one, or if you want to create several smaller partitions so that you can set up a multiboot configuration. If you want to repartition, follow the instructions to delete existing partitions, if needed, and then select unpartitioned space and press ENTER to proceed.
   		<P CLASS="note"><B>CAUTION:</B> Deleting a partition will remove all data stored on that partition. Before you continue, make sure you have backed up everything you want to keep.</P></LI>
	<LI>Select the formatting method you would like to use, and then press ENTER. NTFS offers both enhanced formatting capabilities and security technologies. If you need to access drives or DOS files (such as from a DOS-based boot disk) using Windows Millennium Edition or earlier versions of Windows, you might need to select FAT32 instead. Select either format method (quick or slow).</LI>
 	<LI>Setup will format the drive, copy initial Setup files, and restart the computer.
   		<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B> After the computer restarts, you will again receive the message <B>Press any key to boot from CD</B> but you should ignore it so that you do not interrupt the current installation process.</P></LI>
 	<LI>After another restart, the next part of Setup will begin.</LI>
 	<LI>On the <B>Regional and Language Options</B> page, follow the instructions to add language support or change language settings, if desired.</LI>
 	<LI>On the <B>Personalize Your Software</B> page, type your name and the name of your company or organization (if applicable).</LI>
 	<LI>On the <B>Your Product Key</B> page, type the 25-character product key that came with your copy of Windows&nbsp;XP.</LI>
 	<LI>On the <B>Computer Name and Administrator Password</B> page, make up a computer name (if your network administrator gave you a name to use, type that). Then make up a password for the Administrator account on your computer. Type it once, and then confirm it by typing it again.
   		<P CLASS="note"><B>Important</B>:  Be sure to remember the Administrator password. You'll need this password when you want to make changes to your system in the future.</P></LI>
 	<LI>On the <B>Date and Time Settings</B> page, make any changes that are necessary.</LI>
 	<LI>On the <B>Networking Settings</B> page, if it appears, select <B>Typical settings</B> (unless you plan to manually configure your networking components).</LI>
 	<LI>On the <B>Workgroup or Computer Domain</B> page, click <B>Next</B>. If you want to add your computer to a domain, select the second option and fill in the domain name. (If you do this, you will be prompted for a user name and password.)
   		<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B> Connecting to a domain is only possible in Windows&nbsp;XP Professional, not in Windows&nbsp;XP Home Edition.</P></LI>
	<LI>Next, while Setup copies files to your computer and completes a few other tasks, you'll see a series of screens that tell you about new features in Windows&nbsp;XP.</LI>
 	<LI>Finally, your computer will restart. Again, ignore the message to press any key. After Setup completes, eject the CD from the CD-ROM drive.</LI>

<H1><A NAME="_Toc42069043"></A>Transfer files and settings from another computer</H1>

<P>Did you ever wish that you could easily transfer your files and settings from an old computer to a new one? The Files and Settings Transfer Wizard available in Windows&nbsp;XP can assist you in doing this. This wizard helps take the pain out of upgrading to a new computer.</P>

<P>Here's how to use this wizard:</P>

<P><B>On your new computer:</B></P>
<OL>
 	<LI>Click <B>Start</B>, and then click <B>Files and Settings Transfer Wizard</B>.</LI>
 	<LI>On the <B>Welcome</B> page of the wizard, click <B>Next</B>.</LI>
 	<LI>On the <B>Which computer is this?</B> page, select <B>New computer</B>.</LI>
 	<LI>On the <B>Do you have a Windows&nbsp;XP CD?</B> page, select <B>I will use the wizard from the Windows&nbsp;XP CD</B>, unless you don't have a Windows&nbsp;XP CD. If that is the case, you will need to make a Wizard Disk so that you can run the wizard on your old computer. Select the first option and follow the instructions to make the Wizard Disk.</LI>
 	<LI>Now go to your old computer (or the computer that you're transferring files and settings <U>from</U>).</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>On your old computer:</B></P>
<OL>
	 <LI>If you don't have a Windows&nbsp;XP CD, insert the Wizard Disk that you created into the floppy drive. Click <B>Start</B>, click <B>Run</B>, and then click <B>Browse</B>. Browse to your floppy drive and then double-click the <B>MigWiz.exe</B> file. In the <B>Run</B> dialog box, click <B>OK</B>.
		  <P>If you do have a Windows&nbsp;XP CD, insert it into the CD-ROM drive of the computer you want to copy files and settings <U>from</U> and wait for the startup menu to appear. If the menu does not appear automatically, click <B>Start</B>, click <B>Run</B>, and then click <B>Browse</B>. Browse to your CD-ROM drive and then double-click the <B>Setup.exe</B> file. In the <B>Run</B> dialog box, click <B>OK</B>. Click <B>Perform additional tasks</B>, and then click <B>Transfer files and settings</B>.</P></LI>
	 <LI>On the <B>Welcome</B> page of the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard, click <B>Next</B>.</LI>
	 <LI>On the <B>Which computer is this?</B> page, select <B>Old computer</B>.</LI>
	 <LI>On the <B>Select a transfer method</B> page, choose a method that will work for both computers. For example, you can place the files and settings on a network drive that both computers have access to, or you can use a removable drive. Whatever method you choose, <U>both</U> computers must be able to use it.</LI>
	 <LI>On the <B>What do you want to transfer?</B> page, select one of the three options. Depending on the type of transfer method you choose, some options are better than others here. For instance, if you plan to transfer more than just a few files and settings, choose a method other than floppy disks (since those have the lowest storage capacity). If you decide to change your transfer method, you can always click <B>Back</B>.
		 <P>On this page, you can also select a check box that lets you choose a custom list of files and settings to be transferred. This option is for advanced users.</P></LI>
	 <LI>At this point, you might see a message telling you to install certain programs on your new computer before continuing. This step is not required, but those programs might not work correctly without doing this.</LI>
	 <LI>The wizard now collects the files and settings you requested and prepares to transfer them to the new computer. Insert a disk or removable drive when prompted, if you are using one of those methods.</LI>
	 <LI>On the <B>Completing the Collection Phase</B> page, click <B>Finish</B>. Then go to your new computer, taking along any disk or CD you have used.</LI>

<H1><A NAME="_Toc42069044">Partition and format a hard drive</A></H1>

<P>If there are no partitions on your hard drive, you will need to create a partition and format it. Alternatively, it's a good idea to repartition your hard drive if you want to merge several smaller partitions into one large one, or if you want to create several smaller partitions so that you can set up a multiboot configuration.</P>

<P>If you want to partition or format your hard drive, we recommend that you use the disk partitioning and formatting tools that are built into Windows&nbsp;XP Setup. These tools allow you to delete existing partitions and to create one or more new partitions. </P>

<P CLASS="note"><B>IMPORTANT:</B> If you follow these steps on a hard disk that is not empty, all of the data stored on that hard disk will be permanently deleted.</P>

<P>To use the disk partitioning and formatting tools in Windows&nbsp;XP Setup:</P>

<H1><A NAME="_Toc42069047">Create boot disks</A></H1>

<P>A boot disk is a floppy disk or set of disks that lets you start the computer without using Windows. It can be useful to have this when doing certain types of troubleshooting and when performing a new installation of Windows.  </P>

<P>You can download a program to create the six Windows&nbsp;XP Setup boot floppy disks that contain the files and drivers required to access the CD-ROM drive and begin the Setup process. To do this, go to <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=20508">Obtaining Windows&nbsp;XP Setup Boot Disks</A><SPAN CLASS="printonly"> (http://support.microsoft.com:80/support/kb/articles/q310/9/94.asp)</SPAN>.</P>

<P>However, rather than creating boot disks, we recommend that you boot your computer from the Windows&nbsp;XP CD to start Setup. If your computer is not already able to do this (most newer computers are), refer to the section titled "<A HREF="#_Toc42069048">Configure a computer to boot from CD</A>" for more information. If your computer does not support booting from CD, you can download a file that will help you create boot disks. See the list at the end of this section for download locations.</P>


<H2>Creating the Setup boot disks</H2>

<OL>
	 <LI>When you download the Setup disks, the download contains only one large program file. When you run the downloaded file, it extracts the files to individual floppy disks. You receive the following prompt:
	   <P><B>This program creates the Setup boot disks for Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP. </B></P>
	   <P>To create these disks, you need to provide 6 blank, formatted, high-density disks.</P>
	   <P>Please specify the floppy drive to copy the images to.</P></LI>
	 <LI>Type the drive letter for the floppy disk drive (this is typically drive A). After you type the floppy disk drive letter, you see the following prompt:
	   <P>Insert one of these disks into drive &lt;drive letter&gt;:. This disk will become the Windows&nbsp;XP Setup Boot Disk.</P>
	   <P>Press any key when you are ready.</P></LI>
	 <LI>When you press a key, the downloaded file starts extracting and copying the files. Continue inserting the blank disks as you are prompted to do so until all six disks are created. If the process is interrupted, you must run the downloaded program file again to create all six disks.</LI>
	 <LI>Label each disk with the number that is specified by the program. You must use the disks in the correct order during the Setup process.</LI>
	 <LI>After you create all six disks, insert the first disk in the floppy disk drive, and then restart the computer. Note that the computer must be configured to boot from the floppy disk drive. Most computers will do this automatically, but in some cases, you might need to modify your computer's BIOS settings to do this. For information about modifying your computer's BIOS settings, refer to the section titled "<A HREF="#_Toc42069048">Configure a computer to boot from CD</A>."</LI>
	 <LI>When you restart the computer, the Setup process begins. Insert each floppy disk as you are prompted to do so. You will then be prompted for the Windows&nbsp;XP CD to finish Setup. </LI>
</OL>


<H1><A NAME="_Toc42069048">Configure a computer to boot from CD</A></H1>

<P>Some computers might automatically offer the option to boot from CD if they detect a bootable CD in the CD-ROM drive. If so, when you start the computer with a bootable CD in the CD-ROM drive, you'll see the message "Press any key to boot from CD." Otherwise, you can set your computer to boot from CD by using the setup program for your computer's BIOS (basic input/output system). Here's how:</P>

<UL>
	 <LI>When you first start the computer, look for a short message telling you which key to press for setup. For example, some computers will have this message:  <B>Press DELETE to enter setup</B>.
		   <P>If your computer doesn't give you such a message, try pressing these commonly used keys during startup: </P>
	 <UL>
		   <LI>DELETE</LI>
		   <LI>F1</LI>
		   <LI>F2</LI>
		   <LI>F3, then F2</LI>

		   <LI>CTRL+ALT+ESC</LI>
		   <LI>CTRL+ALT+S</LI>
		   <LI>ESC</LI>
	 </UL>
		   <P>If graphics appear during startup, pressing ESC often makes the graphics disappear so that you can see the correct key for entering BIOS setup.</P></LI>
	 <LI>When you see the message, quickly press the indicated key. You will enter a DOS-like program that consists of one or more screens. You probably won't be able to use the mouse while in this program. BIOS programs vary widely, but look for an option called "Boot order" or something similar.</LI>
	 <LI>Set the boot order to boot from CD before booting from the hard drive.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Some newer laptop computers have a Windows-based utility for configuring the BIOS. If your computer won't boot from a CD, refer to the section titled "Other Setup-related tasks" for information about starting Setup from the command prompt.</P>


<H1><A NAME="_Toc42069049">Set up a multiboot system</A></H1>

<P>You can install more than one operating system on your computer and choose which operating system you want to use every time you start your computer. This is called a dual-boot or multiboot configuration. This section explains how to set up Windows&nbsp;XP as a multiboot system with the following operating systems: </P>

<UL>
	 <LI>Windows&nbsp;2000, Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0, and Windows&nbsp;NT 3.51</LI>
	 <LI>Windows&nbsp;95, Windows&nbsp;98, and Windows Millennium Edition</LI>
	 <LI><NOBR>MS-DOS</NOBR> or Windows&nbsp;3.<I>x</I></LI>
</UL>


<H2>Precautions</H2>

<P>Before creating a multiboot configuration with Windows&nbsp;XP and another operating system, review the following precautions:</P>

<UL>
	 <LI>Be sure to back up your current system and all data files.</LI>
	 <LI>Each operating system must be installed on a separate volume. Microsoft does not support installing multiple operating systems on the same volume.</LI>
	 <LI>If you have only one volume on your computer, you have to reformat and repartition your hard disk to contain multiple volumes before you begin creating a multiboot configuration, unless you are simply installing another copy of Windows&nbsp;XP.</LI>
	 <LI>Do not install Windows&nbsp;XP on a compressed drive that was not compressed using the NTFS compression utility.</LI>
	 <LI>Before installing Windows&nbsp;XP, you should disable antivirus software, and you might want to run the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool to test your computer's random access memory (RAM). To use the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool, follow the instructions on the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19751">Windows Memory Diagnostic</A><SPAN CLASS="printonly"> (http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp)</SPAN> Web site. Be sure to enable your virus protection software after installing Windows&nbsp;XP.</LI>
	<LI>You must use a different computer name for each operating system if the computer is on a Windows&nbsp;2000 or Windows&nbsp;XP domain.</LI>
	 <LI>The operating systems should be installed from oldest to newest. If possible, install operating systems in the following order:
	 <UL>
		<LI><NOBR>MS-DOS</NOBR></LI>
		<LI>Windows&nbsp;95, Windows&nbsp;98 or Windows Millennium Edition
		    <P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B> You cannot install Windows Millennium Edition over any version of Windows&nbsp;NT, but they can exist together on a single system. It is recommended that you install each to a separate hard disk or partition. If Windows&nbsp;NT is already installed, Windows Millennium Edition Setup will add itself to the Windows&nbsp;NT boot menu to allow you to multiboot between Windows Millennium Edition and Windows&nbsp;NT. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 271240.</P></LI>

<H2>Partitioning the hard disk and selecting file systems</H2>

<P>A partition is a logical section of a hard disk. Each partition normally has its own file system. For more information about partitions, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 313348.</P>

<P>You might need to reformat and repartition your hard disk if:</P>
<OL>
	 <LI>You have only one volume but you want to set up a multiboot configuration. You have to install each operating system on a separate volume so that each installation can retain its own files and configuration information.</LI>
	 <LI>The boot volume is not formatted with the correct file system:
	 <OL>
	     <LI>If you want to create a multiboot system by using Windows&nbsp;95, Windows&nbsp;98 or Windows Millennium Edition along with Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP, you have to format the boot volume by using FAT because Windows&nbsp;95, Windows&nbsp;98 and Windows Millennium Edition do not support the NTFS file system.</LI>
	     <LI>If you want to install Windows&nbsp;95 (retail version 4.00.950), your boot volume must be formatted as FAT. Windows&nbsp;95 (OSR2.1 and above) can have a FAT32 boot volume and dual boot with Windows&nbsp;2000 and Windows&nbsp;XP. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 258662.</LI>
	     <LI>If you want to create a multiboot system using Windows&nbsp;95 OSR2, Windows&nbsp;98, or Windows Millennium Edition with Windows&nbsp;2000 or Windows&nbsp;XP, you can format the boot volume by using FAT32.</LI>
	</OL></LI>
</OL>

<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B> If you format a Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0, Windows&nbsp;2000, or Windows&nbsp;XP volume with any file system other than NTFS, you will lose all NTFS-specific features. This includes Windows&nbsp;XP features such as file system security, Encrypting File System (EFS) settings, disk quotas, and remote storage. Likewise, Windows&nbsp;95, Windows&nbsp;98, and Windows Millennium Edition do not recognize an NTFS partition; they will identify it as unknown. Therefore, if you format a Windows&nbsp;98 or Windows Millennium Edition partition as FAT, and a Windows&nbsp;XP partition as NTFS, any files on the NTFS partition will not be available or visible if you try to access them while running Windows&nbsp;98 or Windows Millennium Edition.</P>

<H2>To create a multiboot system with Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 and Windows&nbsp;XP</H2>

<P>Using a multiboot system with both Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 and Windows&nbsp;XP is not recommended as a long-term solution. The NTFS update in Service Pack&nbsp;5 (SP5) for Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 is provided only to help you evaluate and upgrade to Windows&nbsp;XP.</P>


<H3>To create a multiboot system with Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 and Windows&nbsp;XP:</H3>
<OL>
	<LI>Make sure that your hard disk is formatted with the correct file system: either FAT32 or NTFS.</LI>
	<LI>Install Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0, download Windows&nbsp;NT Service Pack&nbsp;5 from Microsoft, and install the service pack. Then install Windows&nbsp;XP to a separate volume.</LI>
	<LI>Install each operating system according to the standard installation procedure.</LI>
</OL>

<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B> If you intend to install more than one operating system consisting of some combination of Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 with either Windows&nbsp;2000 or Windows&nbsp;XP as the only installed operating systems, you must make sure that you have installed Service Pack&nbsp;5 or higher for Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0.

<P>Windows&nbsp;XP automatically upgrades any NTFS partitions that it finds on your system to the version of NTFS that is used in Windows&nbsp;2000 and Windows&nbsp;XP. However, Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 requires Service Pack&nbsp;5 to read and write files on a volume that is formatted with the version of NTFS used in Windows&nbsp;2000 and Windows&nbsp;XP.</P>


<H2>Installing programs on more than one operating system</H2>

<P>If you have more than one operating system, and you want certain programs or drivers to work on both systems, you must install those items on each system separately. For example, if you want to use Microsoft Word on a computer with both Windows&nbsp;98 and Windows&nbsp;XP installed, you have to install Microsoft Word two times (once on Windows&nbsp;98 and once on Windows&nbsp;XP).</P>

<P>You can install the program to the same path for different operating systems, as long as the target location uses a file system both operating systems can read.</P>

<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B> Windows&nbsp;95 or Windows&nbsp;98 might reconfigure hardware settings the first time you use them, which might cause configuration problems when you start Windows&nbsp;XP.</P>

<H2>To use Automated System Recovery:</H2>

<P>We recommend that you regularly create backups as part of an overall plan for system recovery.</P>

<P CLASS="Note"><B>Note:</B>  Restoring from backup should be a last resort for system recovery. Use this method only after you have exhausted other options. For example, you should first try starting the computer in Safe Mode and reverting to the Last Known Good configuration. These steps are described earlier in this section.</P>

<P>Automated System Recovery (ASR) is a two-part system; it includes ASR backup and ASR restore. The ASR Wizard, located on the <B>Start</B> menu under Accessories\System Tools\Backup, does the backup portion. The wizard backs up the system state, system services, and all the disks that are associated with the operating system components. ASR also creates a file that contains information about the backup, the disk configurations (including basic and dynamic volumes), and how to perform a restore.</P>

<P>You can access the restore portion by pressing F2 when prompted in the text-mode portion of Setup. ASR reads the disk configurations from the file that it creates. It restores all the disk signatures, volumes, and partitions on the disks that you need to start the computer. ASR will try to restore all the disk configurations, but under some circumstances it might not be able to. ASR then installs a simple installation of Windows and automatically starts a restoration using the backup created by the ASR Wizard.</P>
